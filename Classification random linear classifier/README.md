# Classification

This repository contains three Jupyter notebooks that demonstrate different aspects of classification algorithms and techniques:

## 1. classification.ipynb

This notebook implements a random linear classifier algorithm for a binary classification problem (dogs vs cats). It includes:

- Implementation of a random linear classifier algorithm
- Synthetic data generation for dogs and cats based on whisker length and ear flappiness
- Visualization of the data and decision boundary
- Error calculation and accuracy measurement
- Interactive plots showing the classification results

## 2. classification_train_test.ipynb

This notebook extends the basic classification approach by introducing:

- Split of data into training and test sets
- Model evaluation on separate test data
- Demonstration of model generalization capabilities
- Validation of classification performance

## 3. classification_train_test_validation.ipynb

This advanced notebook implements a complete machine learning pipeline with:

- Three-way split of data into training, testing, and validation sets
- Model validation techniques
- Hyperparameter tuning
- Performance metrics on all three datasets
- Best practices for model evaluation

Each notebook builds upon the concepts introduced in the previous one, providing a comprehensive learning path for understanding classification algorithms and machine learning model evaluation techniques.
